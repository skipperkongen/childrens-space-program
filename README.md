# Children's Space Program

> What if kids could deploy a sensor platforms into near space?

A project for kids to launch high-altitude weather balloons into near space.

## Small balloon project

In this project you will launch a real weather balloon that is tied to a string, so you can pull it down again :-)

Shopping list:

* Balloon - [$55.00](http://www.highaltitudescience.com/products/600-g-near-space-balloon)
* Helium 3.6 m^3 - [550 DKK per m3](http://www.pegani.dk/dk/product/helium/ballongas-20-l.aspx)
* 500 m fishing line [38 DKK](http://www.harald-nyborg.dk/p1109/fiskeline-0-20mm-500m-2-5kg)
* Fishing rod or other pulley system (to be decided)
* Rig (to be decided)
* Camera (to be decided)
* Sensor (to be decided)
* Communications - ground to balloon (to be decided)
* Ground equipment - screen device that can show live data from balloon (to be decided)

Launch instructions:

* Pick a location (examples):
    * Amager FÃ¦lled
* Pick a day with nice weather:
    * No wind
* Pick mission objective (examples):
    * Reach altitude: 500 m above the ground
    * Imagery: collect aerial photos and video of your town or neighborhood
    * Data collection: gather data from the balloon's onboard sensors

After successful launch:

* Download video and sensor data
* Make a Youtube video that explains and concludes on the mission

## Extended Project

In this project you will launch a real weather balloon into near space. This is an advanced project, which requires better preparation, more gear and more permissions.

Kids divide into groups and complete the project. The structure mimics the division of responsibilities for a real space launch:

* Atmosphere group: How to choose perfect time and place for launch?
* Media group: How to design and video capture the mission?
* Builder group: How to build the balloon platform?
* Tracking group: How to safely land and recover balloon?
* Data group: How to process data from balloon?

Other group (mostly for adults):

* Entrepreneur group: How to get permission and perhaps exploit launch like sponsorships?

## Calculations

The examples below have been calculated with the [balloon performance calculator](http://tools.highaltitudescience.com/). You can [read about the input parameters](http://www.highaltitudescience.com/pages/balloon-performance-calculator) it takes.

### Examples

All the examples below estimate 100 g positive lift.

Example 1:
* 600 g balloon
* 1.5 kg payload
* 2.2 m3 helium required
* Estimated burst altitude 28 km
* Avg. rate of ascent 1.75 m/sec
* Ascent time 4.4 hours

Example 2:
* 600 g balloon
* 2 kg payload
* 2.7 m3 helium required
* Estimated burst altitude 26 km
* Avg. rate of ascent 1.6 m/sec
* Ascent time 4.6 hours

Example 3:
* 1200 g balloon
* 2 kg payload
* 3.3 m3 helium required
* Estimated burst altitude 31 km
* Avg. rate of ascent 1.5 m/sec
* Ascent time 5.7 hours
